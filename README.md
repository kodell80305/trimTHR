# Sand Table Image Path Optimization using Douglas Peucker Algorithm

This README describes how to implement the Douglas Peucker algorithm to optimize path lengths for drawing images on a sand table. Optimizing path lengths reduces drawing time and improves the overall efficiency of the sand table's operation.

# Introduction

Sand tables are devices that use a ball bearing or similar object to draw images in a bed of sand. The images are created by moving the ball bearing along a predefined path. The Douglas Peucker algorithm is a technique used to simplify polygonal curves by reducing the number of points in the curve. This algorithm can be applied to the paths used to draw images on a sand table, resulting in shorter, more efficient paths.

# Algorithm Overview

The Douglas Peucker algorithm works by iteratively removing points from a curve that are within a certain tolerance of a line segment connecting two other points on the curve. The algorithm starts with the line segment connecting the first and last points of the curve. If all the int  
ermediate points are within the tolerance, they are removed. If any point is outside the tolerance, the curve is split at that point, and the algorithm is recursively applied to the two resulting sub-curves.

# Implementation

Here is a basic implementation outline of the algorithm:

1. **Input:** A list of points representing the path to be optimized and a tolerance value.  
2. **Base Case:** If the list of points contains only two points, return the list.  
3. **Find Farthest Point:** Find the point in the list that is farthest from the line segment connecting the first and last points.  
4. **Check Tolerance:** If the distance from the farthest point to the line segment is less than the tolerance, remove all intermediate points and return the list containing only the first and last points.  
5. **Recursive Call:** If the distance is greater than the tolerance, split the list at the farthest point and recursively apply the algorithm to the two sub-lists.  
6. **Output:** A simplified list of points representing the optimized path.

# Usage Example

Assume you have a list of points defining a path for an image:path\_points \= \[(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0)\]

tolerance \= 1.0  \# Adjust as needed

You would apply the Douglas Peucker algorithm to `path_points` with the specified `tolerance` to obtain the optimized path.

# Benefits

* **Reduced Drawing Time:** Shorter paths require less time to draw.  
* **Improved Efficiency:** Less movement of the sand table mechanism leads to reduced wear and tear.  
* **Smoother Drawings:** Optimized paths can sometimes result in smoother lines due to the removal of unnecessary points.

# Considerations

* **Tolerance Value:** The tolerance value determines the level of simplification. A smaller tolerance will result in a path that is closer to the original, while a larger tolerance will result in a more simplified path.  
* **Complexity:** The Douglas Peucker algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average case, where n is the number of points in the path.
